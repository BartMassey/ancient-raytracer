# C++ Raytracer
Copyright Â© 2014 Bart Massey

In about 1990, I wrote a little raytracer in C++ as the
course project for a computer graphics class at
U. Oregon. About 5000 lines; seemed like a great way to
learn the language.

I hate C++.

Anyway, Julian Kongslie got my raytracer up to date and
running again in 2007, fixing a long-outstanding memory
allocation bug that caused slight indeterminism in the
results.

This code has some OK reusable classes, and is reasonably
fast on a modern box. (In 2014, 1000x1000 takes me about
10s. In 1990, 100x100 was minutes.)
